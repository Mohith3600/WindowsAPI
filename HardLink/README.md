# Hard Link 
Hard link Files are pointed to the same section of the hard disk 
Consider two Files File 1 and File 2 
If the changes are made in File 1 the content will be automatically reflected in File 2 
If File 1 is deleted File 2 is still accessible 
Hard Link Files are created in the memeory 
A File can have two different names 
The main advantage of hard links is that compared to soft link , there is no size or speed penalty.
