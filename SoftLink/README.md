# Soft Link 
Soft Links are similar to pointer
File 2 will point File 1 
If File 1 is deleted File 2 will have nothing to point so it will be useless 
Soft Links point to the file unlinke section on the hard drive 
The kernel has to derefernce the link when you open the file 
This takes small amount of time 
Soft links are an extra layer of indirection on top of normal file access
